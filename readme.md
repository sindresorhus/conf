# conf [![Build Status: Linux and macOS](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/conf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/conf) [![Build status: Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/n88jwh3aju39i0p2/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sindresorhus/conf/branch/master)

> Simple config handling for your app or module

All you have to care about is what to persist. This module will handle all the dull details like where and how.


## Install

```
$ npm install conf
```


## Usage

```js
const Conf = require('conf');
const config = new Conf();

config.set('unicorn', 'ðŸ¦„');
console.log(config.get('unicorn'));
//=> 'ðŸ¦„'

// Use dot-notation to access nested properties
config.set('foo.bar', true);
console.log(config.get('foo'));
//=> {bar: true}

config.delete('unicorn');
console.log(config.get('unicorn'));
//=> undefined
```

Or [create a subclass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store/blob/master/index.js).


## API

Changes are written to disk atomically, so if the process crashes during a write, it will not corrupt the existing config.

### Conf([options])

Returns a new instance.

### options

#### defaults

Type: `Object`

Default config.

#### configName

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `config`

Name of the config file (without extension).

Useful if you need multiple config files for your app or module. For example, different config files between two major versions.

#### projectName

Type: `string`<br>
Default: The `name` field in the package.json closest to where `conf` is imported.

You only need to specify this if you don't have a package.json file in your project.

#### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
Default: System default [user config directory](https://github.com/sindresorhus/env-paths#pathsconfig)

**You most likely don't need this. Please don't use it unless you really have to.**

Overrides `projectName`.

The only use-case I can think of is having the config located in the app directory or on some external storage.

#### encryptionKey

Type: `string | Buffer | TypedArray | DataView`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Note that this **is not intended for security purposes**, since the encryption key would be easily found inside a plain-text NodeJS application.

Its main use is for obscurity: if a user was looking through the user config directory and found the config file, since it's a simple json file they may be tempted to modify/add/remove a key/value pair. By providing an encryption key `Conf` will obfuscate the file which should hopefully deter any users from doing so.

It also has the added bonus that it will maintain a config file's integrity: if the file is changed in any way then decryption will not work, in which case the store will just reset back to its default state.

When specified, the `Conf` module will encrypt the store using the `"aes-256-cbc"` encryption algorithm.

### Instance

You can use [dot-notation](https://github.com/sindresorhus/dot-prop) in a `key` to access nested properties.

The instance is [`iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) so you can use it directly in a [`forâ€¦of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop.

#### .set(key, value)

Set an item.

#### .set(object)

Set multiple items at once.

#### .get(key, [defaultValue])

Get an item or `defaultValue` if the item does not exist.

#### .has(key)

Check if an item exists.

#### .delete(key)

Delete an item.

#### .clear()

Delete all items.

#### .size

Get the item count.

#### .store

Get all the config as an object or replace the current config with an object:

```js
conf.store = {
	hello: 'world'
};
```

#### .path

Get the path to the config file.



## FAQ

### How is this different from [`configstore`](https://github.com/yeoman/configstore)?

I'm also the author of `configstore`. While it's pretty good, I did make some mistakes early on that are hard to change at this point. This module is the result of everything I learned from making `configstore`. Mainly where config is stored. In `configstore`, the config is stored in `~/.config` (which is mainly a Linux convention) on all systems, while `conf` stores config in the system default [user config directory](https://github.com/sindresorhus/env-paths#pathsconfig). The `~/.config` directory, it turns out, often have an incorrect permission on macOS and Windows, which has caused a lot of grief for users.
