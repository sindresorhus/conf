	[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) to validate your config data.

	Under the hood, the JSON Schema validator [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) is used to validate your config. We use [JSON Schema draft-07](https://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html) and support all [validation keywords](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md) and [formats](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv#formats).

	You should define your schema as an object where each key is the name of your data's property and each value is a JSON schema used to validate that property. See more [here](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#properties).

	@example
	```
	import Conf from 'conf';

		foo: {
			type: 'number',
			maximum: 100,
			minimum: 1,
			default: 50
